> Note: The Helm chart appears to be inconsistent when it comes to applying and updating CRDs. Since version 68.4.0, the crds.upgradeJob.enabled option is available for upgrading CRDs. See documentation https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack when installtation or upgrades fail.
