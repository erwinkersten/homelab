Feedback, and suggestions are welcome, but please be aware that the repository may not yet be fully functional or stable.

This repository offers an easy-to-use and customizable solution for setting up a Kubernetes clusters in a Proxmox VE home lab environment.

Key Features:

- **Automated Provisioning:** Streamlines cluster setup by leveraging OpenTofu to automate the deployment and configuration of Talos Linux nodes.
- **Advanced Network Security and Observability:** Utilizes Cilium to enforce fine-grained network policies and provide robust observability within the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Secure Secret Management:** Protects sensitive Kubernetes secrets with Sealed Secrets, ensuring secure encryption and storage in Git.
- **GitOps-Driven Workflow:** Implements ArgoCD for automated continuous delivery, maintaining alignment between application deployments and the desired state defined in Git repositories.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Adheres to IaC best practices, ensuring infrastructure configurations are reproducible, version-controlled, and easy to manage.
- **Hardened Kubernetes Environment:** Delivers a secure and reliable cluster through the integration of GitOps practices, automated provisioning, Cilium network policies, and Sealed Secrets.
